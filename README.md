### Description

- This code is being developed in ROS2 Humble
- It is part of the projects developed by the research group Optimization and Control of Distributed Systems
- Working with Navio2, Raspberry pi 4 and Ardupilot
- This repository contains the Matlab scripts necessary to extract information from the different ROS2 bags, as a result of the ASV_Loyola_low level project

# Folder

## Data

In this folder, all automatically generated graphs and data are stored. This folder is included in the .gitignore, and its information should not be loaded into the repository. It should always remain empty.

## Extraer

In this folder, you will find all the scripts necessary to extract each of the topics. The attributes defined for each function include the folder where the ros2bag is located, as well as the topic name to enhance clarity.

## Figuras

In this folder, you will find all the scripts necessary to plot the information of each of the topics. The attributes defined for each function will vary depending on what needs to be plotted; however, it is recommended that the last parameter be the directory where these plots are desired to be stored to enhance clarity.

## Custom

In this folder, you will find all the folders necessary to define the different message types of the packages used in the project. Up to this moment, two folders have been included:
- asv_interfaces
- mavros_msgs

In this folder, the 'matlab_msg_gen' folder will also be generated when the 'first_time.m' script is executed. This folder will be generated by each team to avoid compilation errors and is added to the .gitignore."

# Files

## first_time.m

This program should only be executed the first time this repository is used or each time a new message type or interface is added.

## main.m

This is the main program, which is divided into several sections. In the first section, information is extracted from all the topics to be analyzed. Then, the initial time is subtracted from each of the data points. Next, it is converted into a table to facilitate processing and compression. Subsequently, the data can be saved to a file for storage and later processing, or the defined figures can be visualized.
